# Iterative Prompt Develelopment
In this lesson, you'll iteratively analyze and refine your prompts to generate marketing copy from a product fact sheet.

## Setup
<pre>
      import openai
      import os
      from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
      _ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

      openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
</pre>
<pre>

    def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
